# Second Part Software Engineer (ML & LLMs) Challenge

## Overview

The second part of the **Software Engineer (ML & LLMs)** Application Challenge. In this, you will have the API to consume in order to predict the delay of some flights. The API receives an Object containing the flights to predict. If any of the columns values are incorrect it will raise an HttpException, otherwise return the delay prediction. In order to run the tests a few lines were added in the model.py file and documented.

Additionally, the following method were added to model.py file:
- **check_response**: Given the request predict the delay of the flights or return an error to raise an HttpException.

## Problem

A jupyter notebook (`exploration.ipynb`) has been provided with the work of a Data Scientist (from now on, the DS). The DS, trained a model to predict the probability of **delay** for a flight taking off or landing at SCL airport. The model was trained with public and real data, below we provide you with the description of the dataset:

|Column|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|`Fecha-I`|Scheduled date and time of the flight.|
|`Vlo-I`|Scheduled flight number.|
|`Ori-I`|Programmed origin city code.|
|`Des-I`|Programmed destination city code.|
|`Emp-I`|Scheduled flight airline code.|
|`Fecha-O`|Date and time of flight operation.|
|`Vlo-O`|Flight operation number of the flight.|
|`Ori-O`|Operation origin city code.|
|`Des-O`|Operation destination city code.|
|`Emp-O`|Airline code of the operated flight.|
|`DIA`|Day of the month of flight operation.|
|`MES`|Number of the month of operation of the flight.|
|`AÃ‘O`|Year of flight operation.|
|`DIANOM`|Day of the week of flight operation.|
|`TIPOVUELO`|Type of flight, I =International, N =National.|
|`OPERA`|Name of the airline that operates.|
|`SIGLAORI`|Name city of origin.|
|`SIGLADES`|Destination city name.|

In addition, the DS considered relevant the creation of the following columns:

|Column|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|`high_season`|1 if `Date-I` is between Dec-15 and Mar-3, or Jul-15 and Jul-31, or Sep-11 and Sep-30, 0 otherwise.|
|`min_diff`|difference in minutes between `Date-O` and `Date-I`|
|`period_day`|morning (between 5:00 and 11:59), afternoon (between 12:00 and 18:59) and night (between 19:00 and 4:59), based on `Date-I`.|
|`delay`|1 if `min_diff` > 15, 0 if not.|

## Challenge

### Context:

We need to operationalize the data science work for the airport team. For this, we have decided to enable an `API` in which they can consult the delay prediction of a flight.

*We recommend reading the entire challenge (all its parts) before you start developing.*

### Part II

Deploy the model in an `API` with `FastAPI` using the `api.py` file.

- The `API` should pass the tests by running `make api-test`.

> **Note:** 
> - **You cannot** use other framework.
